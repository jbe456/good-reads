## Don't Try

Chapter undermines our expectations about positive and negative experience.

The backwards law: the pursuit of positive experience is itself a negative experience and the acceptance of a negative experience is itself a positive experience.

Central theme of the book: negativity is actually the path to positivity.

Most people's assumption is, they just want the positive experiences from life, but it's actually the tolerance and acceptance of the negative experience that leads to the positive experience.

The give a fuck framework

1. not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different.
1. do not give a fuck about adversity. You must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
1. you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.

## Happiness Is A Problem

Chapter undermines our expectations about positive and negative emotion.

Dukkha, Buddhism: life is suffering. No matter what you do, where you go, who you hang out with, what you pursue, there is some facet of suffering associated with it. Simply because our mind becomes attached to things and attachment leads to suffering.

This modern idea that we shouldn't have to feel bad ever is completely misguided and goes against our evolutionary nature.

Hedonic treadmill: happiness is like a treadmill. Once you get something, you're always asking for more.

Negative emotions have a lot of utility and purpose, they help us, they grant us meaning in a lot of situations and they signal to us that we have challenges or problems that must be overcome. We should not ignore or escape them.

The emotions themselves are not necessarily good or bad, it's the context around them, it's the meaning around them.

Happiness comes from solving problems. If you either pretend you have no problems in your life to solve, then you won't be happy. But if you also have problems in your life that you feel you can't solve, then you won't be happy. So kind of the secret
sauce is finding problems that you kind of want to have, or kind of enjoy having.

Choose Your Struggle: the question is not 'what do I want out of my life?', everybody wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have
amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make lots of money and be popular and well-respected and admired. The question is 'what pain do I want in my life?', 'What am I willing to struggle for?'

## You Are Not Special.

Entitlement: feeling as though you deserve to be happy without sacrificing for it, you deserve to have positive experiences without traversing the negative experiences to get there.

- grandiose narcissism: I'm awesome and the rest of you all suck. Therefore, I deserve to have special treatment.
- victim narcissism: I suck and the rest of you are awesome,so I deserve special treatment.

Growing culture of exceptionalism: everything is designed to make you feel like you're the most special fucking person on the planet, that is mentally and socially unhealthy because that drives an attitude and a feeling of entitlement, that you are somehow the exception, that the world owes you something, that you should be able to have positive experiences without accepting the negative.

> All of this 'every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness' stuff is basically just jerking off your ego. It's a message that tastes good going down but in reality, is nothing more than empty calories that make you emotionally fat and bloated, the proverbial Big Mac for your heart and your brain.
>
> The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies, that is accepting the bland and mundane truths of life. Truths such as, your actions actually don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things and the vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's okay.
>
> This vegetable course will taste bad at first, very bad, but once ingested, your body will wake up feeling more potent and alive."

## The Value of Suffering.

- What is worth struggling for?
- What is worth valuing?
- What is worth sacrificing for?

It doesn't matter how disciplined you are, it doesn't matter how motivated you are, it doesn't matter how strong you are, how intelligent you are, how much support you have, if you have the wrong goal, you're fucked.

Good values:

- reality-based
- socially constructive
- immediate and controllable

Bad values:

- superstitious
- socially destructive
- not immediate or controllable

Example: Honesty is a good value because it's something that you can have complete control over, it reflects reality and it benefits others, even if it's sometimes unpleasant.

## You Are Always Choosing.

Example: Running a marathon tomorrow as a blackmail (bad experience) vs willingly training for it and running that same marathon (good experience). The actual pain of running the marathon isn't any different. The only thing that's changed is the context and what has actually changed is the perception that you chose to run the marathon or not.

> When we are choosing our struggles or what problems we have in our life, they seem much more acceptable and easier for us to deal with.
>
> When we feel as though our problems and our struggles are thrust upon us without our control, that's when we suffer and feel completely powerless.

Value of "constant responsibility": You are always choosing, whether you realize it or not. There's no such thing as a situation where you are not choosing your struggle or not choosing your problem. The only thing that changes is whether you admit it to yourself or not.

Responsibility vs fault: We assume that if you are responsible for something, it means that it's your fault but these are two completely different things.

As soon as we become aware of that choice, two things happen.

1. we become way more comfortable with pain
1. we actually get off our ass and fucking do something

Indeed, we don't care whose fault it is anymore, if it's boring or tedious or unfair. You fucking do something, you realize in every moment, you have a choice, to do something or not do something, to blame somebody else or take responsibility yourself.

## Why You're Wrong About Everything, But So Am I.

Our present day beliefs should look ridiculous to us in the future because that means that we've grown and become smarter.

Benefits of uncertainty:

- It opens up space for you to learn and improve.
- It helps guard you against like extremist ideology or just becoming like a crazy zealot for some cause.
- It opens room for dialogue with people, to learn from other people, to make other people feel more heard, which improves relationships.

Law of avoidance: the more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

protecting
our ego from perceived threats

and so, Manson's law basically says that,

like the more threatening something is,

the more we will become certain in things

that will help us avoid
dealing with that truth.

An extension of Manson's
law of avoidance is that,

we should define ourselves as loosely and ambiguously as possible because the less defined ourself is, the less we need to cling to defense mechanisms or faulty ideas to protect ourselves.

Buddhist idea: no self. If there is no such thing as self, then there's nothing to protect and there's nothing that you need to be certain about in the first place.

1. What if I'm wrong?
1. Would it mean if I were wrong?
1. Would being wrong create a better or worse problem than my current problem, both for myself and others?

## Failure Is The Way Forward.

Do Something principle

Most people assume that you need motivation to have action but it's the other way around.

Action leads to motivation

## The Importance of Saying No.

If you're willing to traverse the negative to get to the positive,
If you're willing to take responsibility for your struggles,
If you're willing to accept failure on the way to success,
then being able to say no to people,

being able to manage conflict,

that's probably a good thing
to have for your relationships

and sure enough, that's
pretty much how I would define

Healthy relationship = two people who are comfortable saying and hearing no from each other, telling what they don't like, telling what their values are, be willing to disappoint the other person and trust that they're gonna stick with you. Because if you are never willing to disappoint your partner, then you never actually developed trust for them and know if they're going to stick with you when shits the fan.

Rejection Makes Your Life Better: in order to value one thing, you have to reject the other things.

Hidden freedom of commitment: finding that one or two things in your life that are more important than anything else and committing full-heartedly to them.

On the surface, it sounds limiting as we like to always keep your options open.

As soon as you limit yourself to a few things in your life that you truly care about, there's a new form of freedom that happens on a very subtle level, which is that, I don't have to give a fuck about many stuff.

## And Then You Die.

It's only when you confront death or come close to death, that it's most clear to you what you should be giving a fuck about and therefore we should regularly question our own mortality: "if I died a year from now, what would I do with my last year?" "If I died tomorrow, or if I got diagnosed with cancer tomorrow, like, would I have any regrets? Would I feel like I wasted time? If so, what was the time I wasted?"
