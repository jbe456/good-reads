The better your self- belief, internal self- talk, attitude, focus, and mental climate are going into an event, the better your situation will be when the event energy is pumping through you.

Whatever is going on inside your head has everything to do with how well you end up performing.

## Chapter 1: The Three Minute Lesson

One should never look where one does not wish to go.

No matter what your game is, or what the challenge is, the difference between great performances and average performances is mostly mental. Once you reach a certain level of skill, it’s your mental skills that start making all the difference.

## Chapter 2: On Attitude

A bad attitude can cost you everything, it affects not only how you feel, but also how you perform. Warriors with negative attitudes become victims of their own negative outlook; they lose because their own negativity drains them. A negative attitude will always find a way to work against you. Even if one finds a way to win despite a bad attitude, the fact is that he could always have performed better still.”

A good attitude, a positive attitude, creates optimism, positive energy. And positive energy is much better at setting good things into motion than negative energy is. Winning has a lot to do with having a good attitude. Not only in competition, but also in life generally. A positive attitude helps create the opportunity for a great comeback or for a great performance— A positive attitude never works against you.

“A champion teaches himself the skill of turning things around inside his head, he learns how to look at a negative setback both as temporary, and even as an opportunity for positive change. He knows that the things he can learn from his loss will make him even better, even stronger, in the long run. The Mental Warrior learns from his setbacks and he doesn’t allow them to distract him from reaching his true potential. So, keep your self-talk positive. Keep your outlook positive. By doing so, you give yourself the best chance to perform well. Take on your inner feelings with courage and determination; never allow a bad attitude to hold you back from achieving the level of personal success that you are capable of. Never beat yourself up after a loss— there’s always something positive to be gained, something to be learned, even from a negative situation.”

“Give yourself just five more minutes to feel bad about this thing if you really feel you need to, and then after those five minutes are up, decide to start seeing the experience as an opportunity to help you figure out how to create a positive change in the level of your play. Turn it around in your head,”

Mental control starts with a decision.

## Chapter 3: Gaining the Mental Edge

Pelé explained how he began to watch a film in his mind’s eye: a film of himself as a kid playing soccer on the beach in Brazil. He let this “movie” bring back glorious memories of the sand, the warm sun on his back, the ocean breeze feathering his temples. He would vividly recall the thrill of the game, the joy that it brought to him; he would immerse himself in his love of the game, allowing himself to relive those glowing memories. Allowing himself to feel them.

Pelé described how he began to review and watch himself relive some of his greatest moments in world competitions. He talked about letting himself feel and enjoy the intensity of those winning feelings over and over again. He would see himself as he was about to become: playing brilliantly, scoring goals, dribbling past defenders in a mental movie made up of positive images with strong feelings of enjoyment and triumph. He imagined everything before it ever happened: the crowd, the atmosphere, the field, his own team, his opponents, he saw himself playing irresistibly like a champion— as a force that could not be stopped. But the most important was to remember that it was not just about vision and imagery, but also about feeling the emotions associated with success.

Create an internal place where their minds can go before any event in order to rehearse, visualize, feel, and prepare exactly as Pelé used to. This is where you go to play and watch your mental highlight tapes; this is where you once again connect with the fun and love of your sport, to feel that winning feeling. Most of all, this is where you go to mentally prepare yourself and to gain the mental edge before battle.

For the athlete who’s just starting out and who may not have past successes to replay, I suggest that they pretend that they do and that they watch themselves as if they did.

## Chapter 4: Learning to Fly Navy Jets

The rule is: don’t rush when the pressure’s on— **smooth is fast**. Breathe, pause, and learn to gather yourself— but never, ever, allow yourself to rush your game.

To interrupt any negative thoughts or self- talk the instant you notice them by saying to yourself— cancel/ cancel, and then immediately replacing the negativity by firing off positive self- talk. Things like: I’m fast, I’m focused, I’m good.

Shutting down negative self- talk begins by interrupting it, and then instantly replacing it.

Set some time aside to practice some “Imagineering” during daily relaxation sessions. During these times, he allowed only images and feelings of victory and success to be associated in his mind with the upcoming event.

Stay task- focused. Interrupt negative self- talk and images the moment they arise, shut them down on the spot. Replace them with positive self- talk and positive images. Concentrate on showing your brain exactly what it is that you want to achieve, never dwell on what you do not want to happen.

## Chapter 5: The Importance of Self-Belief

Self- belief. You must always begin by believing that you have what it takes. When the pressure is on, the more you believe in yourself, the better your performance will be.

Use imagination to see himself in his mind’s eye accomplishing his most desired success while in a deep relaxed state of awareness.

## Chapter 6: Imagineering & Self-Confidence

What’s really the key with Imagineering is that you not only see and watch, but that you actually feel yourself succeeding, over and over again.

Never allow yourself to entertain images or feelings of defeat during your Imagineering sessions.

If you feed it suggestions of worries or failure then you will defeat yourself— with no other opponent necessary.

Imagineering is vital because it leads to greater self- belief and greater confidence, which in turn leads to better performance and achievements.

## Chapter 7: The Critical Three

To draw the air in deeply and slowly to the bottom of my lungs through my nose, while expanding the diaphragm. Then, after holding it momentarily, he slowly pushed the air out of the lungs by drawing the diaphragm in. He explained that it’s important to let the air out through a relaxed and slightly opened mouth while keeping the tip of the tongue pressed lightly against the ridge behind the front teeth, with the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.

Relaxation matters because when used with mental imagery it facilitates and allows our inner (subconscious) mind to clearly see our success imagery and feel our success feelings.

It’s only when we are in a deep state of relaxation that the conscious mind quits acting as a filter for the inner mind. It's when the critical conscious mind is set aside through relaxation (for several minutes) that our Imagineering can reach the inner mind directly.

Relaxation skills are what open up the lines of communication between the inner mind and your Imagineering. Proper breathing helps you go deeper into relaxation whenever you so desire.

Move to a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed. Lie down on your back with your feet slightly apart, arms slightly extended from your body, palms facing down, and make sure you are as comfortable as possible before proceeding. (In other words: no tight or restrictive clothing, temperature not too hot, not too cold, etc. Get comfortable). Now, fix your eyes on a point above you on the ceiling. Remaining as still as you can, begin by taking three long, deep, deep, breaths, inhaling through your nose. Hold each breath temporarily, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. And with each breath that you release, I want you to feel a wave of relaxation begin to overwhelm you as you let go and begin to enjoy the process. As you exhale the third breath, gently let your eyelids begin to close. Now, for the next ten breaths, imagine your eyelids getting heavier and heavier. I want you to mentally repeat the word “deeper” as you exhale and let all tension and thoughts disappear every time you breathe out. Let yourself go deeper into relaxation with each breath that you let out. If your mind drifts, that’s okay; just gently bring your attention back to learning how to relax and how to let go as you exhale and mentally repeat the word “deeper” slowly to yourself. After ten easy breaths, you are ready to begin focusing on relaxing the muscles of every part of your body. Start with your toes and begin moving up your body as total relaxation begins to take over. Focus on relaxing each and every muscle in your body. From toes to calves, to thighs, to abs, to chest, to back, to arms, to shoulders, and even to your neck: every muscle letting go and completely relaxing. Continue all the way up to the scalp and facial muscles. Visualize each muscle loosening, and feel a wave of deep relaxation flowing deeply into all of your muscles, into all of your body. Allow yourself to go deeper into relaxation with each breath that you take. Don’t rush it, don’t force it; simply allow your muscles to turn loose, go limp and relax naturally as you experience the serenity of total relaxation. (Sometimes clients tell me that a leg or arm twitched or moved involuntarily for an instant and they ask me about it. That’s nothing to be concerned about; it’s only the deep hidden tension being triggered and released from where it has been hiding. The release of this hidden tension is both therapeutic and healthy.) Now, allow yourself to enjoy this state of relaxation for about twenty minutes, maybe a little more. Drift in this sea of healthy relaxation and during this time, while in this deeply relaxed state, watch yourself as in a movie, and project images in your mind’s eye of you achieving what you desire. See it as being true. Feel it. Show your mind through images and feelings what you will accomplish. See it clearly. Watch yourself accomplishing it. Experience it inwardly as if it were already true.

## Chapter 8: The Mental Warrior

Their self- confidence is too deeply rooted to be shakeable. They arrive on the scene to dominate. They love to compete; competing energizes them. They repel negative thoughts; they control their internal environment. They know how to remain focused under even the most challenging conditions.

## Chapter 9: Controlling Anger

Real champions work to develop an ability to control their anger so that it cannot hurt their performance.

They ask themselves, ‘Who is in charge here?—Me? Or this fury inside myself?’ By that simple act, the warrior spirit begins to regain control. And that control begins with a simple choice, a decision. The warrior decides to channel the anger into making his resolve stronger still.

Use internal self- talk with suggestions like: Stay Cool, Relax, Be Calm—

If anger arises, make the decision to not let it control you. Use techniques to redirect the energy; use the energy to make your resolve stronger. Become like the smiling assassin that sees his mark.

## Chapter 11: On Losing

When things don’t go their way, they know it’s OK to be disappointed. What’s not OK is dwelling on the disappointment. Champions keep it in perspective. They are able to accept responsibility and recognize the situation as a temporary setback nothing more, nothing less.

Learn from it— and let it go.

## Chapter 12: Fear of Failure

Being afraid to fail actually helps create the conditions that make failure more likely!

What typically causes a fear of failing is the state of mind that takes hold when a competitor is afraid of looking bad, or else is such a perfectionist that he’s become overly self- critical.

Rather than abandoning himself to the luxury of misery, he will methodically shut down that destructive voice of internal self- criticism in favor of looking at failure as valuable feedback.

Fear of failure is caused by not knowing how to fail constructively. The only way to accomplish anything great is to risk failing at it first. If you have a fear of failing, it’s more than just a bad thing. It can actually cripple your chances of success.

## Chapter 13: Controlling Fear

Fear can turn a competitor from someone trying to win, into someone trying not to lose.

You must focus and breathe in a controlled way. Watch your breathing. Control your breathing. Doing this has a calming effect; but more importantly, it brings you back into the present moment. Once you are back, once you have returned to the present— you (or any warrior) must then face his fear.

## Chapter 14: On Performance Choking

Choking is actually caused by an ego that’s worried about looking bad, not by any real or perceived danger.

## Chapter 15: Cool Under Pressure

All the pressure you feel really comes from inside yourself. Once you understand this, you can begin to free yourself to do what you are really capable of.

Learn to concentrate and use focused breathing. The athlete can bring himself back to the present moment.

Let the air reach into the very bottom of your lungs. Then, as you release the breath, release any tension and anxiety along with it.

Coping affirmations.

Have you own personal affirmations. (I’m good, I’m fast, I’m strong, This is my time, Believe, I dominate.) What they may be doesn’t matter as long as they help you take the pressure off yourself. Create three quick affirmations (positive statements) you can fire off to yourself to complement the breathing and relaxation techniques mentioned above.

Thinking about something that relaxes them. Some do this while wearing headphones listening to whatever it may be that helps them take the pressure off themselves.

They allow themselves to let go of the need to achieve any particular outcome. They set out to compete with the feeling that they have nothing to lose. Confident that their years of solid training will take over,

Having experienced their greatest moment in sports through releasing themselves from any fear of failure.

Other athletes have a ritual or pre-game routine that they like to stick with and that helps them deal with the pressure.

To recall a time when you managed a pressurized situation really well. Go back in your mind’s eye and take note of exactly what you did right. What worked? What did you do? Were you still for a while before going into the match? Were you able to lose yourself in the moment? What was your self-talk like? What was going on inside your head that helped you reduce the pressure?

## Chapter 16: The Internal Critic

They all had negative self-talk going on when things were going really badly.

At the precise instances when they needed all their resolve in order to be able to turn things around, their self-talk was busy tearing them down.

We’d play the tape again, only this time the exercise was to have the athletes verbalize positive self-talk as things got bad. I’d say, ‘This time, let me hear the positive self-talk of a champion who might be having a tough time during the match but who absolutely refuses to talk himself down.’

If there is any self-talk going on it must be positive, encouraging, and empowering.

## Chapter 17: Too Intense

Coming in too high on the performance curve will actually end up hurting their performance.

A good mental athlete learns early on at what level of intensity he plays his best game. On a scale of one to ten (with ten being at the most intense level) most top athletes report that they perform best at around levels seven or eight. Occasionally, of course, they may need to call on their full intensity and “raise their game” to nine or ten.

## Chapter 18: Your Dream

Think about what you want to become, how you want things to be. For a little while, you need to do some Imagineering. Close your eyes and see yourself and everything around you the way you want it to be.

## Chapter 19: On Goals

Turn their dreams into reality by taking action through goal setting.

When an athlete complains of lacking motivation, you can be sure that it’s almost always caused by goals that fail to inspire him to action. Goals serve to keep you on target. They increase the desire to achieve. Goals increase your self-confidence as you experience measurable improvement.

While setting your own, private goals, be sure that they are both challenging and realistic.

What you are striving for is progress rather than perfection.

State your goals in a way that emphasizes what you want to happen, not what you want to avoid.

## Chapter 20: Do the Work

“Well, the harder I work, the luckier I get!”

With very few exceptions, the truth is that the best athletes usually turn out to be the ones who work the hardest.

So don’t be discouraged if you’re not exactly what a coach would consider a huge talent.

## Chapter 21: Getting There

It’s not what they know that’s important; it’s what they can still learn that makes the biggest difference.

The fastest way to improve is to work, not on their strengths, but on their weaknesses.

The mental athlete must be resolutely clear on exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are.

## Chapter 22: Changing Your Mental State

you can alter your thoughts and your state by focusing on three different critical elements.

If you were a great champion with tons of experience at this level, and if you had an incredible record, and if you were at the top of your game where no one could touch you, what would your self-talk sound like as you prepared to go into this match?

Well, how about things like: I’m strong, I’m fast, I dominate. I control the match, I never give in, I never give up. I’m powerful, I beat my opponent, I’m an unchained lethal gladiator, I conquer. I’m an unstoppable champion, a force of fury, my opponent submits. Or how about these? I’m ready, I take charge, I keep going, I don’t let up, I win, I’m tougher, I’m stronger, I’m better, I stop my opponent.

Pretend you're an actor. Start being that champion. Start hearing the self-talk of that champion.

Ask yourself: What would the self-talk of a champion be like as he prepared for competition? How would that champion be moving his body around as he prepared? And how would that champion be breathing as he prepared to enter the competition and face his opponent? Then do it. Bring it all together for several minutes prior to your time, and allow yourself to enter into this totally prepared and empowered state before you compete. Get out of your own way. Let your training take over.

## Chapter 23: The Present

To learn how to be there throughout the competition, that is your goal. To consistently play in the Present moment, where mind and body are as one, where training takes over, where no thoughts interfere.

Skills the Warrior/Champion must possess to help him reach his maximum potential are the ability to recognize when his mind is not focused on the Present, and the ability to bring it back into the Present.

There’s no worry, no judging, no fearing, no hoping; the mind is totally in the here and Now throughout the event. You must practice leaving all the mental clutter, all the personal situations, all the distractions that fill up your head, outside of the arena. While it’s crucial to have learned from the past, there is also a time to leave the past behind you.

## Chapter 24: Prepare to Win

Confidence comes from knowing you are prepared both physically and mentally. Confidence helps you know what to do automatically even when you’re not sure.

There must be no lack of commitment in your mind. Eliminate doubt. There’s no room for it.

You’re creating neuro-muscular connections that are going to take over when you learn how to get out of your own way.

Mental training helps the warrior develop the ability to set the analytical mind aside long enough so that his training can take over and he can fight by instinct. When this happens you’re confident, relaxed, determined. Everything flows.

It’s a matter of learning how to leave your conscious mind out of it, and letting your training take over.

You must do battle with all your heart in order to have no regrets as you leave the contest behind. A champion always prepares to win. Remember to act like a champion in order to become a champion
